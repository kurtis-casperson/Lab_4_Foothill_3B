# Description:

## For this lab project I created two programs

Total Sales

Design a program that asks the user to enter a store’s sales for each day of the week. The amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for the week and display the result.

Capital Quiz

Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values. (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.) The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user to enter that state’s capital. The program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses. (As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of countries and their capitals.)
